For information on Turkish vowel harmony and how it works, see this [document](https://github.com/University-of-Utah-CS3505/a8-edu-app-MikeWelsh801/blob/main/Turkish-Vowel-Harmony.md). 

The information in the vowel harmony document is not intended to be comprehensive and other processes that interact with vowel harmony in Turkish
are omitted for scope and brevity.

This is a 2D sidescroller written in C++ and implemented in QT.

The purpose of this game is to teach the player the basics of Turkish vowel harmony,
which is a linguistic process in which all vowels in a word must share certain features.

As vowels come across the screen, the player must attack the box with the correct
vowel on it in order to fill the appropriate vowel slot in the current word shown
in the center of the screen.

Screenshots are shown below.
