Some suffixes assimilate only in backness, ie front vowels or back vowels. 
Suffixes that only assimilate in backness have alternations between e and a.

An example of this is the plural suffix +l_r. In the first example below, 
notice how the vowels in the stem çocuk are back and rounded. 
Here, the vowel in the plural suffix +l_r surfaces as a, which is harmonized 
in backness but is unrounded.

In the second example below, notice how the vowel in the stem  gün is front 
and rounded. Here, the vowel in the plural suffix +l_r surfaces as e, which is 
harmonized for backness (both vowels are front vowels) but is unrounded.

	çocuk+l_r -> çocuklar 'children'
	gün+l_r -> günler 'days'

Other suffixes assimilate in both backness and rounding. Suffixes that 
assimilate in backness and rounding have alternations between i,ı,ü,u.

An example of this is the first-person singular suffix +_m. In the first 
example below, notice how the vowel in the stem gün is a front, rounded vowel. 
The vowel in the first-person singular suffix +_m then assimilates in both 
backness and rounding and surfaces as ü.

In the second example, the vowel in the first-person singular suffix +_m 
assimilates to the preceding vowel in the stem kol in backness and rounding, 
and surfaces as u.

	gün+_m -> günüm 'my day'
	kol+_m -> kolum 'my arm'
